GIT CHEAT SHEET

SCENARIO 1: You want to get the most updated work from the github repository

    ** ALWAYS DO THIS TO ENSURE THE REPO ON YOUR PERSONAL DEVICE IS UP TO DATE
    WITH THE REPO THAT LIVES ON THE GITHUB SERVER BEFORE MAKING CHANGES IN THE
    REPO ON YOUR PERSONAL DEVICE **

In terminal, navigate to your git hub repo folder on your personal device:

>> cd Desktop/Person_Projects/bk_defenders_surveillance_capstone

Pull the most recent version of github repository:

>> git pull


 SCENARIO 2: You have made changes to the repo on your personal device and you
 want to push those changes to the repo in github

    ** ALWAYS DO THIS WHENEVER YOU ARE DONE WITH YOUR WORK, EVEN IF IT IS NOT
    COMPLETE SO THAT OUR BRANCHES DO NOT DIVERT TOO FAR FROM ONE ANOTHER **

In terminal, make sure you are in the git hub repo folder on your personal device:

>> cd Desktop/Person_Projects/bk_defenders_surveillance_capstone

stage all of our changes & specify what you did via the message:

>> git add . && git commit -m "add your message here"

push your changes to the github repository:

>> git push origin main

SCENARIO 3: You are trying to open jupyter hub via terminal and you intend on
using geo-packages like geopandas.

In terminal navigate to desired folder, like our capstone repository:

>>cd Desktop/Person_Projects/bk_defenders_surveillance_capstone

activate your geo environment:

>>conda activate geo_env

open jupyter notebooks:

>>jupyter notebook
